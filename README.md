# Warema WMS Webcontrol Controller

This library can connect to a Warema WMS WebControl web server to send control commands.

Currently only vertical blinds are supported. Feel free to extend support to other devices.

Usage:

```python
from warema_wms import Shade

shades = Shade.get_all_shades()
shades[0].set_shade_position(25) #0=open; 100=closed
shades[1].get_shade_state(True) #Force update and get shade state
```

in case your WebControl server is not under `http://webcontrol.local` you'll 
have to create and pass your own WmsController.

```python
from warema_wms import WmsController, Shade

shades = Shade.get_all_shades(WmsController('http://server_addr'))
```


An undocumented example integration for home assistant can be found here:
